# DSA-Java-Practice

This repo is part of my 60-day commitment (June 22 – August 22, 2025) to get better at Java and DSA, and crack a good job or internship.

Every file here is something I wrote and tested myself — no copy-paste or ctrl+c and ctrl+v stuff. I’m uploading daily progress, starting from the basics.

### Why this repo?

No fake projects. No UI. Just raw problem solving, daily effort, and proof that I’m doing the work.

If you're a recruiter or mentor looking at this — I’m not trying to look fancy, I’m just showing up every day and putting in the effort.
